# LDWS - Lane Detection Warning System

1. This Lane Detection Warning System uses concepts of digital image processing like gaussian blur, canny edge detector, hough transform and edge tracking by hysteresis. 
2. The system first forms a region of interest, subsequently applies transforms on that ROI to increase the information we percieve. 
3. Algorithms like Canny edge detectors and edge tracking by hysteresis help accentuate the gradient lines formed by sudden changes in intensity.
